# TMB tier site

## [Reset (Earthshaker)](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/guild/id/639641)

Takes [ThatsMyBIS](https://thatsmybis.com) data, and generates a website into the docs folder, hosted in github pages. It shows a few things:

- Wishlisted items and their received status (current phase)
- Per-phase, per-slot indicators whether an item has been "Main-spec" received, with some special-sauce logic that we use to provide conditional discounts on upgrades
- Tooltips for mainspec loot received

TO DO:

- automate data load (selenium?)
- Perhaps create and publish an addon that will show an icon in RCLootcouncil?
